TheNoobBot is a software that intend to reproduce real players movements in the World of Warcraft game 3D environment.

The bot do uses injection of ASM for several actions such as Click To Move, Interact, Lua Executions.
The bot do read the WoW memory, after retrieving the offsets addresses of the usefuls value from the executable file.

TheNoobBot project have been public since 17 february 2012, for the WoW version 4.3.3 and the project was active until Legion.

TheNoobBot has been closed for sale on 31 december 2017, and the source code is now available as of 31 august 2018.

This source code is now mainly legacy, the project started back in 2011, before it even had a Git.

I've greatly learned about differents aspect of C# along the years, there is alot of code that could be easily improved or rewritten, we're all in constant evolution after all.

Thanks to all our former custommers for this journey !
